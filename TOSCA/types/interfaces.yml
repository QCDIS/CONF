      code_type:
        type: string
        required: true
        default: SEQ
        description: This field indicates the type of this code. Currently, there are only two types, ‘SEQ’ and ‘LOOP’.
        constraints:
          - valid_values: ['SEQ' , 'LOOP']     
      object_type:
        type: string
        required: true
        default: SubTopology
        description: This field indicates the object type of this operation. According to the specific operation, the object can be, 'SubTopology', some entire sub-topologies; VM, some individual VMs; REQ some requests, only used when vscale, hscale or recover.
        constraints:
          - valid_values: ['SubTopology' , 'VM' ,'REQ' ] 
      objects:
        type: list
        required: true
        description: It indicates a set of objects, which this operation impacts. If the ObjectType is SubTopology, the name of the object is the sub-topology name; If the ObjectType is VM, the name of the object is the VM full name, containing sub-topology and VM node name, such as, $SubTopology.$Node; If the ObjectType is REQ, the name of the object is previously generated request name.        
      command:
        type: string
        required: false
        description: The detailed command, when the operation is execut
      options:
        type: map
        required: false
        description: Some options defined for this operation. They are key-value pairs. It depends on the specific operation.
      count:
        type: integer
        required: false
        description: This is defined as a maximum number of iterations for a loop.
      duration:
        type: scalar-unit.time
        default: 1 s
        required: false
        description: This is defined as a maximum number of iterations for a loop
      deadline:
        type: timestamp
        required: false
        description: This is defined as a certain timing to exit this loop.
    execute:
      description: Execute some command on the objects. The detailed command is specified in the filed Command below. ObjectType currently can only be VM
    put:
      description: Upload some input data or files to the remote resources. ObjectType currently can only be VM.
    get:
      description: Download or retrieve output results or files from the remote resources. ObjectType currently can only be VM.
    vscale:
      description: Vertically scale up or down to adapt the computing capability of the infrastructure through directly changing the capacity of some VM. ObjectType can only be VM and REQ.
    hscale:
      description: Horizontally scale out or in to adapt the computing capability of the infrastructure through changing the number of VMs. ObjectType can be SubTopology, VM or REQ.
    recover:
      description: Recover some failed sub-topologies. ObjectType can be SubTopology or REQ.
